## Introduction to Slice

IceRPC provides everything you need to make RPCs. When you use only IceRPC's
core API, the payload of your requests and responses are streams of bytes, and
you need to manually encode and decode any typed data (such as strings and
integers) in these streams. This is doable but tedious. Fortunately we have a
solution: Slice.

Slice is a completely revised Interface Definition Language, [IDL], and
serialization format designed for RPCs. It allows you to define a "contract" in
a programming language neutral way. Slice can be used with any RPC framework, or
with no RPC framework at all; in particular, Slice does not depend on IceRPC.

Nevertheless, Slice and IceRPC play well together and are designed to be used
together. It specifies the syntax and semantics for RPCs but leaves the actual
implementation of this RPC support to external integrations.

#### Example

The Thermostat interface below defines 3 operations, or RPCs, in Slice:

```slice
interface Thermostat {
   getCurrentTemperature() -> float64
   getHistoricalTemperature(timeStamp: WellKnownTypes::TimeStamp) -> float64
   streamTemperature() -> stream float64
}
```

The Slice compiler augmented by the IceRPC + Slice integration parses this Slice
interface and generates code in the programming language of your choice. The
resulting generated code offers you a convenient typed RPC API implemented
using IceRPC requests and responses.

## Clean syntax

Slice provides a readable, modern syntax inspired by Rust and Swift. Slice
supports streaming with the `stream` keyword, understands optionals with the
usual `?` suffix, requires minimal punctuation, and more.

{% slice1 %}
{% side-by-side alignment="top" %}

```slice
// An ImageStore interface defined with Slice

interface ImageStore {
    uploadImage(person: Person, bytes: Sequence<uint8>)

    retrieveImage(person: Person) -> Sequence<uint8>
}
```

```slice
// A Person class defined with Slice

class Person {
   name: string
   id: int32
   tag(1) email: string?
}
```

{% /side-by-side %}
{% /slice1 %}

{% slice2 %}
{% side-by-side alignment="top" %}

```slice
// An ImageStore interface defined with Slice

interface ImageStore {
    uploadImage(person: Person, bytes: stream uint8)

    retrieveImage(person: Person) -> stream uint8
}
```

```slice
// A Person struct defined with Slice

struct Person {
   name: string
   id: int32
   tag(1) email: string?
}
```

{% /side-by-side %}
{% /slice2 %}

Slice provides [primitive] types with clear names such as `uint16`, `float64`
and `string`, and allows you to define your own types with a few building
blocks:

- [struct]
- [enum]
- [custom]
- [Sequence]
- [Dictionary]

Last but not least, Slice's [tagged] fields and parameters allow you to update
your structs and operations over time without breaking on-the-wire
compatibility.

## Flexible and extensible

You can fine-tune the API generated by the Slice compiler with Slice [attributes]. For example, in C#, you
can map a sequence to an array (the default), or to a list, or even to a hash set:

```slice
interface Translator {
    getLanguages() -> [cs::type("HashSet<string>")] Sequence<string>
}
```

The `cs::type` attribute changes the mapping for values decoded by the generated code and returned to you. For values
you give to the generated code, the mapping for a `Sequence<string>` parameter is always `IEnumerable<string>`.

Slice's custom types allow you to send any type you wish through Slice. You just need to provide methods to encode and
decode instances of your custom type.
