## Encoding statement

A Slice file has always an associated encoding, which can be either Slice1 or Slice2.

The encoding determines how the arguments and return values of operations defined in that file are encoded into streams
of bytes. Slice supports two distinct and incompatible encoding formats: Slice1 and Slice2. The encoding process is
described in the [Encoding](../encoding/main-features) section.

The encoding of a Slice file also determines the syntax you can use in that file. For example, a `class` can only appear
in a Slice1 file, while a `varint32` can only appear in a Slice2 file.

You specify which encoding to use with the encoding statement. This statement (if present) must be the first statement
in the file. For example:

```slice
// Copyright (c) ACME Corp.

encoding = Slice1
```

If your Slice file has no encoding statement, it uses the default encoding, Slice2.

You should use Slice1 if you need interoperability with Ice applications; otherwise, you should keep the default,
Slice2.

## Encoding compatibility

The encoding for operation arguments and return values is not the same with Slice1 and Slice2; as a result, an encoding
mismatch between your client and server will result in a decoding failure. For example, the following operations are not
compatible even though they look almost identical:

{% side-by-side alignment="top" %}
```slice
encoding = Slice1

module Example

interface Widget {
    spin(speed: int32)
}
```

```slice
// default encoding is Slice2

module Example

interface Widget {
    // Not compatible with the Slice1 spin operation.
    spin(speed: int32)
}
```
{% /side-by-side %}

## Slice types compatible with Slice1 and Slice2

You can reference a type defined in a file using the Slice1 encoding (Slice1 file) from a file using the Slice2 encoding
(Slice2 file) provided this type can be encoded with Slice2. For example:

```slice
encoding = Slice1

module Example

// Can be encoded with both Slice1 and Slice2.
compat struct Point { x: int32, y: int32 }

// Can be encoded with Slice1 but not Slice2.
class Vehicle {
    hasEngine: bool
}

// Can be encoded with Slice1 but not Slice2
// because it references a class.
compat struct VehicleCarrier {
    vehicle: Vehicle?
}
```

On the other hand, it is always an error to reference a type defined in a Slice2 file from a Slice1 file.

## C# mapping

The encoding statement is not mapped to anything in C#. It does however influence the C# mapping of most other Slice
definitions.
