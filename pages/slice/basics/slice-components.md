title: Slice components
description: A short description of each Slice component.

Slice is made of several related components:

- the Slice language\
The Slice language is a computer language specifically designed for RPCs. You use Slice to specify RPCs and types used
by these RPCs. It's a simple language without any execution logic: no if, no while, no print. While you specify your
RPCs in Slice, you implement the actual "business logic" using the programming language of your choice (C#, Rust,
Python...). The Slice language is an [Interface Definition Language][idl] or IDL.

- the Slice encoding\
The Slice encoding specifies how Slice language constructs such as `string`, `int32`, `float64`, `struct`, operation
parameters (and more) are encoded into streams of bytes. The Slice encoding is a simple, compact, binary encoding. Most
Slice users don't need to know the details of this encoding.

Then, for each programming language that Slice supports (currently C#, and soon Rust, Python and more), Slice provides:

- a Slice language mapping\
A language mapping is a set of rules that specifies how Slice language constructs are represented in that language.
For instance, a Slice `struct` is mapped to a `struct` in C#. The C# language mapping specifies the name of this struct,
its fields, its constructors etc.

- a Slice compiler\
A language mapping is implemented by a tool—the Slice compiler—that generates code from your Slice definitions to the
mapped language. In C#, the Slice compiler for C#, `slicec-cs`, compiles Slice files into C# files. When a Slice file
defines a (Slice) struct, the corresponding C# file contains the mapped C# struct.

- Slice library code\
The code generated by the Slice compiler relies on Slice-specific library code in the target language. For example, the
code generated by the Slice compiler for C# relies on [`SliceEncoder`][slice-encoder] and
[`SliceDecoder`][slice-decoder], two C# structs defined in namespace [`ZeroC.Slice`][namespace] that can encode resp.
decode a variety of types to or from byte buffers. This library code is divided in an RPC-independent core (the
`ZeroC.Slice` assembly in C#) and integration code for a specific RPC framework such as the `IceRpc.Slice` assembly. The
code generated by the Slice compiler always depends on the RPC-independent core and optionally depends on an 
RPC + Slice integration library.

All these Slice components work together to help you make RPCs without having to worry about encoding intricacies. Your
primary responsibility is to use the same Slice definitions in your client and server applications; the Slice library
code and the code generated by the Slice compiler implement the Slice encoding and take care of all the
encoding/decoding details.
