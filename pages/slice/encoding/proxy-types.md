## Encoding

{% slice1 %}
A null proxy is encoded as the [null Ice identity](/icerpc-for-ice-users/rpc-core/ice-identity) (two empty strings).

A non-null proxy is encoded as the following `ServiceAddressData` struct:

```slice {% addMode=true %}
compact struct ServiceAddressData {
    identity: Identity             // The service address path converted to an Ice identity (two strings).
    facet: Sequence<string>        // The fragment encoded as an empty sequence or a 1-element sequence.
    invocationMode: InvocationMode // IceRPC always encodes Twoway and ignores this value during decoding.
    secure: bool                   // IceRPC always encodes false and ignores this value during decoding.
    protocolMajor: uint8           // 1 for ice and 2 for icerpc.
    protocolMinor: uint8           // Always 0.
    encodingMajor: uint8           // IceRPC always encodes 1 and ignores this value during decoding.
    encodingMinor: uint8           // IceRPC always encodes 1 and ignores this value during decoding.
    serverAddressList: Sequence<ServerAddressData>
    adapterId: string              // Encoded only when serverAddressList is empty.
}

compact struct Identity {
    name: string
    category: string
}

enum InvocationMode { Twoway, Oneway, BatchOneway, Datagram, BatchDatagram }

compact struct ServerAddressData {
    transportCode: int16 // the TransportCode (see below) encoded as an int16
    encapsulation: Encapsulation
}

compact struct Encapsulation {
    size: int32              // payload size + 6
    encodingMajor: uint8     // always 1
    encodingMinor: uint8     // always 1
    payload: uint8[...]      // pseudo-Slice
}

unchecked enum TransportCode {
    Uri = 0
    Tcp = 1
    Ssl = 2
}
```

The format of the encapsulation payload in a `ServerAddressData` depends on its transport code.

With transport code `Uri` (0), this payload is a URI string: the server address converted into a URI string, including
the protocol/scheme. `Uri` is a wildcard transport code since the actual transport is specified in the URI string, or is
left unspecified when the server address has no transport parameter. `Uri` is the only valid transport code with the
icerpc protocol.

{% callout type="information" %}
The Slice1 encoding supports only two RPC protocols: ice and icerpc. Encoding an icerpc proxy with Slice1 is possible
but uncommonâ€”it's much more common to encode ice proxies with Slice1.
{% /callout %}

Other transport codes identify specific transports, such as tcp, ssl, ws (for WebSocket), wss (WebSocket with TLS) etc.

Transport codes `Tcp` and `Ssl` share the same encapsulation payload format:

```slice {% addMode=true %}
compact struct TcpServerAddressBody {
    host: string
    port: int32      // limited in practice to uint16
    timeout: int32   // timeout parameter
    compress: bool   // z parameter
}
```

See [Endpoint](../../icerpc-for-ice-users/rpc-core/endpoint) for additional information.
{% /slice1 %}

{% slice2 %}
A proxy is encoded as a URI [string](../primitive-types#String). This URI can be absolute or relative.
{% /slice2 %}

## IceRPC service address {% icerpcSlice=true %}

The IceRPC + Slice integration encodes a proxy by encoding its [service address]. The name of the interface / proxy type
is not encoded.

[service address]: /icerpc/invocation/service-address
