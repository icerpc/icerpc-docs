{% slice1 %}

## Class

The class encoding is complex and stateful. Since a class instance can point to another class instance (or even itself)
and bring this instance into the encoded byte stream, the class encoding requires an indexing system and a scope (the
buffer where all the class instances are encoded).

The class encoding is described in the [Ice manual][ice-manual-class-encoding]. Slice1 corresponds to encoding version
1.1 in the Ice manual.

When encoding operation arguments and return values, IceRPC encodes classes in the compact format by default, just like
Ice. You can switch to the sliced format with the [`slicedFormat`][sliced-format-attribute] operation attribute.

During decoding, Slice considers all classes that use the sliced format to be fully [preserved][slice-preservation].

{% callout type="information" %}
There is no attribute to turn off class slice preservation during decoding: it's always on.
{% /callout %}
{% /slice1 %}

## Enum

{% slice1 %}
An enumerator is encoded as its associated numeric value using the [variable-length size][slice1-var-size] encoding.

For example:

```slice {% addMode=true %}
enum Fruit { Apple, Strawberry, Orange = 300 }
```

A `Strawberry` is encoded as 1 on 1 byte. An `Orange` is encoded as 255 (1 byte) followed by 300 encoded as an
`int32` (5 bytes total).
{% /slice1 %}

{% slice2 %}
An enumerator is encoded as its associated numeric value, using the encoding of the enumeration's underlying type.

For example:

```slice
enum Fruit : uint16 { Apple, Strawberry, Orange = 300 }
```

A `Strawberry` is encoded like a `uint16` with value 1 (on 2 bytes). An `Orange` is encoded like a `uint16` with value
300.
{% /slice2 %}

The encoding is the same for checked and unchecked enums.

## Exception

{% slice1 %}
An exception is encoded like a [class](#class) with the same fields. Slice always encodes exceptions in sliced format;
it can decode exceptions in any format.

Exception slices are not preserved during decoding: if Slice encounters a slice it doesn't know while decoding an
exception in sliced format, this slice is dropped.
{% /slice1 %}

{% slice2 %}
An exception is encoded exactly like a [struct](#struct) with the same fields.
{% /slice2 %}

## Struct

{% slice1 %}
A compact struct is encoded as its fields, in definition order, without any framing.

{% callout type="information" %}
The name of the struct and the name of the struct's fields are not encoded at all. As a result, changing these names
does not break the "on-the-wire" contract.
{% /callout %}

_Example: simple compact struct_

```slice {% addMode=true %}
compact struct Point { x: int32, y: int32 }
```

A point x = 5, y = 32 is encoded as follows:

```
0x05 0x00 0x00 0x00: x's value (5 on 4 bytes in little-endian order)
0x20 0x00 0x00 0x00: y's value (32 on 4 bytes in little-endian order)
```

{% /slice1 %}

{% slice2 %}
A struct is encoded as:

- a [bit sequence][bit-sequence] with N bits, where N is the number of non-tagged fields with optional types in the
  struct, followed by
- the non-tagged fields encoded in definition order, followed by
- the tagged fields

The bit sequence is empty (and occupies no byte) when none of the struct's fields has an optional type (ignoring tagged
fields).

Each non-tagged field is encoded as follows:

- if the field has a non-optional type, encode the field value as usual.
- otherwise:
  - if the field value is set, set the corresponding bit in the bit sequence and encode the field value as usual.
  - otherwise, make sure the corresponding bit in the bit sequence is unset and don't encode anything else for this
    field.

The tagged fields of a struct are encoded in tag order (not in definition order); the field with the lowest tag number
is encoded first. For each tagged field:

- if the field value is not set, don't encode anything
- otherwise encode this field as `[number][size][value]` where number is the tag number encoded as a varint32, value is
  the encoded field value and size is a `varuint62` with the number of bytes in value.

Finally, we mark the end of the tagged fields (and the end of the struct) with the "tag end marker", -1 encoded as a
`varint32`.

### Compact struct

If a struct is marked `compact`, it cannot have any tagged field and its encoded representation does not include the tag
end marker.

The encoding of a regular (non-compact) struct always includes the tag end marker byte, even when it has no tagged
field. This is why a compact struct is slightly more compact than a regular struct.

{% callout type="information" %}
The name of the struct and the name of the struct's fields are not encoded at all. As a result, changing these names
does not break the "on-the-wire" contract.
{% /callout %}

_Example: simple compact struct_

```slice
compact struct Point { x: int32, y: int32 }
```

A point x = 5, y = 32 is encoded as follows:

```
0x05 0x00 0x00 0x00: x's value (5 on 4 bytes in little-endian order)
0x20 0x00 0x00 0x00: y's value (32 on 4 bytes in little-endian order)
```

_Example: compact struct with a bit sequence_

```slice
compact struct Contact {
  id: int32
  name: string?
  age: uint8?
}
```

The contact id = 5, name = not set, age = 42 is encoded as:

```
0b00000010:          bit sequence with only the bit at position 1 set
0x05 0x00 0x00 0x00: id (5)
-                    nothing for name since the bit at position 0 is not set
0x2A:                age (42 encoded on a single byte)
```

_Example: simple struct_

```slice
struct Point { x: int32, y: in32 }
```

A (non-compact) point x = 5, y = 32 is encoded as follows:

```
0x05 0x00 0x00 0x00: x's value (5 on 4 bytes in little-endian order)
0x20 0x00 0x00 0x00: y's value (32 on 4 bytes in little-endian order)
0xFC:                tag end marker (-1 varint32, encoded on 1 byte)
```

_Example: empty struct_

```slice
struct Empty {}
```

An instance of Empty is encoded as:

```
0xFC: tag end marker
```

_Example: struct with tagged fields_

```slice
struct Contact {
  id: int32
  tag(1) name: string?
  tag(2) age: uint8?
}
```

The contact id = 5, name = not set, age = 42 is encoded as:

```
-                    empty bit sequence since no non-tagged field has an optional type
0x05 0x00 0x00 0x00: id (5 on 4 bytes, little-endian)
-                    nothing for the name since it's not set
0x10:                age's tag (2 as a varint32 on 1 byte)
0x04:                age's value size (1 as a varuint62 on 1 byte)
0x2A:                age's encoded value on a single byte
0xFC:                tag end marker (-1 varint32, encoded on 1 byte)
```
