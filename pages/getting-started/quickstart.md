title: Quickstart
description: Effortlessly jump into IceRPC
---

This quickstart shows how to quickly get up and running with a complete
application with IceRPC for C# using the IceRPC .NET Project Templates.
We start from scratchâ€”you just need to have the .NET 7 SDK installed on your
computer.

If you would like a more in-depth tutorial, you can follow

The networked application we are building together consists of:

- a server that hosts a single service (a simple greeter service)
- a client that establishes a connection to the server and calls `greet` on
  this greeter service

The client and server are console applications that use plain .NET (no ASP.NET,
no Dependency Injection).

Let's jump right in:

{% step title="Install the dotnet-new templates for IceRPC" %}

```shell {% showTitle=false %}
dotnet new install IceRpc.Templates
```

{% /step %}

{% step title="Create the server" %}

Now, let's create the server application by using the `icerpc-slice-server`
template we installed in the previous step:

```shell
dotnet new icerpc-slice-server -o MyServer
```

This command creates a new IceRPC + Slice server application application in
directory `MyServer`.

{% /step %}

{% step title="Create the client" %}

Similarly, let's create the client application:

```shell
dotnet new icerpc-slice-client -o MyClient
```

This command creates a new IceRPC + Slice client application in directory
`MyClient`.

{% /step %}

{% step title="Run the application" %}

Now that we have created both the client and server applications, we can run
them.

### Start the server

Navigate to the server directory and run the server:

```shell
cd MyServer
dotnet run
```

The server is now listening for new connections from clients:

```
dbug: IceRpc.Server[11]
      Listener 'icerpc://[::0]?transport=tcp' has started accepting connections
```

### Start the client

Now, navigate to the client directory and run the client:

```shell
cd MyClient
dotnet run
```

The client sends a single `greet` request to the service hosted by our server:

```
dbug: IceRpc.ClientConnection[3]
      Client connection from '[::1]:61582' to '[::1]:4062' connected
info: IceRpc.Logger.LoggerInterceptor[0]
      Sent request greet to icerpc:/VisitorCenter.Greeter over
      [::1]:61582<->[::1]:4062 and received a response with status code Ok
Hello, Reece!
dbug: IceRpc.ClientConnection[6]
      Client connection from '[::1]:61582' to '[::1]:4062' shutdown
dbug: IceRpc.ClientConnection[5]
      Client connection from '[::1]:61582' to '[::1]:4062' disposed
```

{% /step %}
