description: Learn how to write an interceptor and how to install an interceptor in your invocation pipeline.

## Definition

An interceptor is nothing more than an [invoker](../invocation-pipeline#the-invoker-abstraction) that holds another
invoker ("next") and calls `invoke` on this next invoker as part of the implementation of its own `invoke` method. This
next invoker can be a `ClientConnection`, a `ConnectionCache`, another interceptor, or some other kind of invoker, it doesn't
matter.

An interceptor can include logic before calling `invoke` on the next invoker (before the request is sent) and after
calling `invoke` on the next invoker (after it receives the response). An interceptor can also short-circuit the
invocation pipeline by throwing an exception or returning a cached response.

For example, a simple C# interceptor could look like:

```csharp
public class SimpleInterceptor : IInvoker
{
    private readonly IInvoker _next;

    public SimpleInterceptor(IInvoker next) => _next = next;

    public async Task<IncomingResponse> InvokeAsync(OutgoingRequest request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("before _next.InvokeAsync");
        IncomingResponse response = await _next.InvokeAsync(request, cancellationToken);
        Console.WriteLine($"after _next.InvokerAsync; the response status code is {response.StatusCode}");
        return response;
    }
}
```

## Installing an interceptor

In C#, you can create an invocation pipeline by creating an instance of class [Pipeline](csharp:IceRpc.Pipeline) and
then calling `Use{Name}` extension methods to install interceptors on this pipeline.

For example:

```csharp
Pipeline pipeline = new Pipeline().UseLogger(loggerFactory).UseCompress().Into(clientConnection);
```

You need to specify the last invoker of the pipeline with `Into`. It's usually a client connection or a connection
cache, but it can also be another pipeline since `Pipeline` is itself an invoker.

When you make an invocation on a pipeline, the request goes through this chain of invokers. On the way back, the
incoming response goes through the same chain in reverse order.

    app([application code]) -- request --> i1[Logger] -- request --> i2[Compress]
    i2 -- request --> ti["client connection"] -- request --> connection
    connection -- response --> ti -- response --> i2 -- response --> i1 -- response --> app
```

The order in which you install these interceptors is often important. The first interceptor you install is the first
interceptor to execute. With the pipeline we created above, the logger interceptor executes first, then calls
`InvokeAsync` on the compress interceptor, and then finally the compress interceptor calls `InvokeAsync` on the client
connection.

## Installing an interceptor with Dependency Injection

If you use Microsoft's Dependency Injection container, you'll want to use an invoker builder instead of `Pipeline` to
create your invocation pipeline. The `Use{Name}` extension methods for `IInvokerBuilder` retrieve dependencies
automatically from the DI container.

For example:

```csharp
services.AddIceRpcInvoker(builder => builder.UseLogger().UseCompress().Into<ClientConnection>())
```

This is equivalent to our earlier example except `UseLogger` retrieves the logger factory from the DI container.

{% callout type="information" %}
There is only one `LoggerInterceptor` class, one `CompressInterceptor` class etc. These interceptors can be installed in
several different pipeline implementations, such as `Pipeline`, the implementation inside the builder created by
`AddIceRpcInvoker`, or even your own custom pipeline class. Each pipeline implementation just needs its own set of
`Use{Name}` extension methods.
