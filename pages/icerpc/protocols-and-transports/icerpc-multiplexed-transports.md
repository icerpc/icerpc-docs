## The icerpc protocol

When you create a client connection to server address `icerpc://hello.zeroc.com`, you instruct IceRPC to establish a
connection that uses the icerpc protocol.

icerpc is an [application layer][application-layer] protocol that transmits RPCs (requests and responses) over a
multiplexed connection.

{% callout type="note" %}
We always spell icerpc in lowercase when discussing the icerpc protocol. This avoids confusion with the IceRPC
framework.

## Multiplexed transport

The [multiplexed transport][multiplexed-transport] page describes an abstraction for a modern transport that provides
independent streams within a connection. The prototypical multiplexed transport is
[QUIC].

An icerpc connection runs over a multiplexed connection created by a multiplexed transport.

```mermaid

    class IceRpcConnection
    class MultiplexedConnection {
        <<abstraction>>
    }
    class QuicConnection
    IceRpcConnection o-- MultiplexedConnection
    MultiplexedConnection <|-- QuicConnection
```

The icerpc protocol sends requests and responses over a multiplexed connection by creating a dedicated bidirectional
stream for each request + response pair. It creates a unidirectional stream for each one-way request, since a one-way
request has no response.

    subgraph Client [icerpc client connection]
    end
    subgraph Server [icerpc server connection]
    end
    subgraph stream0 [stream]
        s0["> request >\n < response <"]
    end
    subgraph stream1 [stream]
        s1["< request <\n > response >"]
    end
    subgraph stream2 [stream]
        s2["> one-way request >"]
    end
    subgraph stream3 [stream]
        s3["> request >\n < response <"]
    end
    subgraph stream4 [stream]
        s4["< one-way request <"]
    end
    Client --- s0
    Client --- s1
    Client --- s2
    Client --- s3
    Client --- s4
    s0 --- Server
    s1 --- Server
    s2 --- Server
    s3 --- Server
    s4 --- Server
```

Since each stream is independent, there is no [head-of-line blocking][head-of-line-blocking]. You can send a mix of
large and small requests and responses over the same connection: the large requests and responses won't block or delay
the small ones.

## IceRPC's preferred protocol

icerpc is naturally IceRPC's preferred protocol.

icerpc provides the most direct realization of IceRPC's APIs and features. In particular, IceRPC's [request
fields][request-fields], [response fields][response-fields] and [status codes][status-code] are transmitted as-is by icerpc. It also supports [payload continuations][payload-continuation].

## icerpc over a duplex connection

There is currently only one standard multiplexed transport: QUIC. Since QUIC is new and not universally available, you
may want to use icerpc with a traditional duplex transport such as TCP.

The solution is IceRPC's Slic transport layer. Slic implements the multiplexed transport abstraction over the
[duplex transport][duplex-transport] abstraction.

```mermaid

title: icerpc over tcp

classDiagram
    class IceRpcConnection
    class MultiplexedConnection {
        <<abstraction>>
    }
    class SlicConnection
    class DuplexConnection {
        <<abstraction>>
    }
    class TcpConnection
    IceRpcConnection o-- MultiplexedConnection
    MultiplexedConnection <|-- SlicConnection
    SlicConnection o-- DuplexConnection
    DuplexConnection <|-- TcpConnection
```

In C#, the default multiplexed transport is Slic over TCP and is called `tcp`. The following statements all create
equivalent icerpc connections.

```csharp
// Create a client connection with the default multiplexed client transport, Slic over TCP.
using await var clientConnection = new ClientConnection("icerpc://hello.zeroc.com");

// Make sure we use Slic over TCP (correct but redundant).
using await var clientConnection = new ClientConnection("icerpc://hello.zeroc.com?transport=tcp");

// Create a new multiplexed client transport with default options.
var clientTransport = new SlicClientTransport(new TcpClientTransport());
using await var clientConnection = new ClientConnection(
    "icerpc://hello.zeroc.com",
    multiplexedClientTransport: clientTransport);
```
