## Receiving an incoming response

The `invoke` method of an [invoker](invocation-pipeline#the-invoker-abstraction) returns an incoming response
asynchronously. This incoming response is created by the connection when it receives the response from the peer.

An incoming response holds:

- a [status code](#status-code)
- an error message, set only when the status code is not `Success`
- response [fields](#response-fields)
- the [payload](#response-payload) of the response

## Status code

The status code represents the status of the [dispatch](../dispatch/dispatch-pipeline#definition) by the peer. It can be
`Success` or an error. [`StatusCode`][status-code] is an enumeration defined in Slice:

```slice
unchecked enum StatusCode : varuint62 {
    Success = 0
    ApplicationError
    ServiceNotFound
    OperationNotFound
    ... more errors ...
}
```

The caller that consumes the response uses this status code to figure out the format of the response payload. For
example when the caller is code generated by the [Slice][slice] compiler, it interprets `Success` as meaning the
response payload holds a Slice-encoded return value.

## Response fields

The response fields represent out-of-band information carried by a response. These fields are usually read and written
by [middleware](../dispatch/middleware) and [interceptors](interceptor) in an effort to coordinate the processing of the
same response in the server and in the client.

A field is an entry in a dictionary `ResponseFieldKey` to sequence of bytes, where
[`ResponseFieldKey`][response-field-key] is an enumeration defined in Slice.

```slice
unchecked enum ResponseFieldKey : varuint62 {
    CompressionFormat = 2
    ...
}
```

For example, when the compressor middleware compresses the payload of an outgoing response, it sets the response field
`CompressionFormat`. This tells the compressor interceptor on the other side of the connection "this payload is
compressed with brotli"; the compressor interceptor can then decompress this (incoming) response payload.

## Response payload

The payload of an incoming response is a stream of bytes that represents the return value of an operation. As far as the
IceRPC core is concerned, the number of bytes in this stream is unknown.
