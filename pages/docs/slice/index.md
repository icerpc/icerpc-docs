description: An introduction to Slice
---

Slice is a combination of two components: an [Interface Definition Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language) (IDL) to describe RPCs, and an encoding
that specifiers how Slice language constructs are encoded into streams of bytes.

If you're new to Slice your first step should be to [understand the problem that Slice solves](/docs/slice/basics/why-use-slice). If you're already familiar with Slice and are looking for a specific topic, you can use the navigation on the left to find what you need.
