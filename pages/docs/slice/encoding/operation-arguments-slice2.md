## Slice segment

A Slice segment is a `varuint62` size followed by size bytes, just like a `sequence<uint8>`. A Slice2-encoded request or
response payload is either empty or starts with a Slice segment.

## Outgoing request payload

The arguments of an operation--stream argument aside--are encoded as a Slice segment into the payload of an outgoing
request.

This Slice segment contains:
- a [compact struct](constructed-types-slices2#struct) holding all the non-tagged arguments, in definition order
- the tagged arguments

The tagged arguments are encoded in tag order (not in definition order); the argument with the lowest tag is encoded
first. For each tagged argument:
- if the argument value is not set, don't encode anything
- otherwise, encode this argument as: `[tag][size][value]` where tag is the tag encoded as a `varint32`, value is the
encoded argument value and size is a `varuint62` with the number of bytes in value.

{% callout type="information" %}
The encoding of the arguments does not use a tag end marker because the end of the segment marks the end of the
argument list.
{% /callout %}

## Outgoing request payload continuation

The stream argument of an operation (if present) is encoded into the payload continuation of an outgoing request. If
there is no stream argument, the payload continuation is empty.

If the stream parameter type is an optional type (for example, an `int32?`), the stream is encoded like a stream of:
```slice
compact struct Element { value: T? }
```

where `T?` represents the stream parameter type.

If the stream parameter type is fixed-size (e.g., an `int32`), the stream is encoded as successive elements without any
demarcation.

If the stream parameter type is variable-size (e.g., a `string` or an `int32?`), the stream is encoded as a series of
Slice segments, where each segment holds a whole number of encoded elements--at least 1 per segment. The segment's size
corresponds to the number of bytes in the segment, not the number of streamed elements encoded in this segment.

## Empty optimization

As an optimization, when an operation has no argument at all, the empty argument list can be encoded as an empty
payload plus an empty payload continuation.
