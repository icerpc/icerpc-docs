## Syntax

A server address is a [URI](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986.html) with the following syntax:
`protocol://host[:port][?name=value][&more name value params...]`

- `protocol` (the URI scheme) is either `ice` or `icerpc`
- `host` is a DNS name or an IP address
- `port` is the port number; when not specified, the default port is 4061 for ice and 4062 for icerpc

A server address URI must have an empty path and no fragment. It can have query parameters; these parameters are usually
transport-specific.

The query parameter `transport` specifies the name of the underlying transport. Most applications use a single transport
and configure this transport as the only transport they can use. As a result, it is common to leave out `transport`
in server addresses.

In C#, struct `ServerAddress` is just a parsed and validated representation of a server address URI: it holds exactly
the same information.

## Client connection configuration

The main configuration for a client connection is the server's address. It tells the client connection how to reach the
server.

For example:

- `icerpc://hello.zeroc.com`
connect to `hello.zeroc.com` on port 4062 using the icerpc protocol; the underlying transport is not specified

- `icerpc://192.168.100.10:10000?transport=quic`
connect to `192.168.100.10` on port 10,000 using the icerpc protocol over quic

- `ice://hello.zeroc.com`
connect to `hello.zeroc.com` on port 4061 using the ice protocol

## Server configuration

You can specify the server address to listen on when you construct a server.

If you don't specify a server address, the default is `icerpc://[::0]`, which means listen for icerpc connections on
all interfaces on the default icerpc port.

When constructing a server, the host of the server address must be a wildcard IP address such as `[::0]`, or the IP
address of a specific interface on the current system.

If you specify `0` for the port number, the OS will automatically assign a port number in its ephemeral range. The
server won't listen on tcp or udp port 0.

Here are some examples:

- `icerpc://192.168.100.10`
listen for icerpc connections on the interface associated with `192.168.100.10`, using the default icerpc port

- `icerpc://[::0]:0`
listen for icerpc connections on all interfaces; the OS selects the port number to use

- `ice://0.0.0.0:10000`
listen for ice connections on all interfaces with an IPv4 address on port 10,000

In C#, when you specify port `0` in your server address, `Listen` returns a server address with the port number selected
by the OS:

```csharp
using IceRpc;

await using var server = new Server(..., new Uri("icerpc://[::1]:0"));
ServerAddress actualServerAddress = server.Listen();
Console.WriteLine($"server is now listening on {actualServerAddress}); // shows actual port
// then somehow share this server address with the clients
```
