## Definition

The process of sending a request and receiving the corresponding response is called an invocation.

You would typically make invocations over client connections. Nevertheless, since client and server
[connections](../connection/client-vs-server-connections) have the same capabilities, you can also make invocations over
server connections.

## The Invoker abstraction

With IceRPC, you always make an invocation by calling an invoker. An invoker is a simple abstraction with a single
`invoke` method that accepts an [outgoing request](outgoing-request) and returns an
[incoming response](incoming-response).

In C#, this abstraction is the `IInvoker` interface:

```csharp
namespace IceRpc;

public interface IInvoker
{
    Task<IncomingResponse> InvokeAsync(OutgoingRequest request, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
}
```

Both `ClientConnection` (C# LINK) and `ConnectionCache`(C# LINK) implement this interface. This allows you to make an
invocation by creating a client connection or a connection cache and then calling `InvokeAsync` on the resulting
instance:

```csharp
await using var clientConnection = new ClientConnection(new Uri("icerpc://hello.zeroc.com"));
using var request = new OutgoingRequest(...);

// Make an invocation by calling the IInvoker.InvokeAsync method implemented by ClientConnection.
IncomingRequest response = clientConnection.InvokeAsync(request);
```

## Invocation processing

It is common to perform additional processing on an invocation before giving it to a connection. For example, you may
want to compress the payloads of your requests, add a telemetry field to each request, add a timeout or deadline, or
simply add logging.

You can configure this processing by creating a chain of invokers--the invocation pipeline. Each node of this pipeline
is an invoker that calls `invoke` on the next invoker in the pipeline. The last invoker in the pipeline is a connection
managed by a ClientConnection or ConnectionCache. The other invokers are typically [interceptors](interceptor).
