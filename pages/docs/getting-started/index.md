## Get stared with IceRPC

Getting started with IceRPC is easy. This page will help you get up and running with IceRPC in no time.

If you're new to IceRPC, we recommend you start with the [What is IceRPC](/docs/getting-started/what-is-icerpc) page.
If you're already familiar with IceRPC, you can jump right in with the [Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation) page.

Once you're up and running, you can learn more about IceRPC by reading the [IceRPC Core](/docs/icerpc-core) documentation
and by checking the [IceRPC C# API Reference](https://api.testing.zeroc.com/csharp).
